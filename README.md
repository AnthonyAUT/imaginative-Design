Started this project in August 2017.

This is my first time converting a photoshop template to HTML/CSS. 

I have built this website from scratch with the help of W33schools and Don Duckett's books. I had fun learning and made some choices to the facebook icon and a favicon. It is not perfect, I have tried to replicate to the template. Moving forward, I hope to one day get back into this with new found knowledge and convert or create a responsive version of this template.

The origin template can be found here:
