Started this project at the start of August 2017.

This is my first time converting a photoshop template to HTML/CSS. 

I have built this from scratch with the help of W33schools and Don Duckett.  

It is not perfect, there are some design choices I added myself, mainly the facebook icon and favicon. I have tried to replicate to the best of my ability. Moving forward, I hope to one day get back into this with new found knowledge and convert or create a responsive version of this template.


The origin template can be found here.
